Using `fish` instead of `bash` is much nicer. Install it. Install `fisher`. Install `bass` so as to be able to source bash in fish (useful for eg `gcloud`), and put `bash source ~/.bash_profile` in `.config/fish/config.fish`.

Remember that we can always run bash scripts as `bash script.sh` instead of `./script.sh`.
